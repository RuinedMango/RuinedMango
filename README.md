# Im Ruinedmango ;)
I make crappy projects and code like a 5-year-old.

Half of my projects are spaghetti code and the other half are unfinished games.
# My goals
My goal on GitHub is to try out all the hardest and most popular programming languages.

so far I've done

![C#] ![C] ![Java] ![NASM] ![Python]

# Languages that are annoying
Any language with a non-curly brace or non-semicolon syntax.

[C#]: ./icons/csharp.webp
[C]: ./icons/c.webp
[Java]: ./icons/java.webp
[NASM]: ./icons/nasm.webp
[Python]: ./icons/python.webp
